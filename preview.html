        <h2>Winter in Red Deer Doesn't Have to Be a Battle</h2>
        <p>It's 6:15 AM on a Tuesday. You look out the window and see 20 centimetres of fresh snow covering your driveway. Your sidewalk is buried. The city requires it cleared within 24 hours, or you face a fine.</p>
        <p>You have two choices: shovel now and risk being late for work, or shovel later and risk your back giving out. Again.</p>
        <p>This isn't a one-time problem. In Red Deer, winter means repeated snowfalls. It means -20°C mornings where your breath freezes and your hands go numb. It means wet, heavy snow that strains your heart and leaves you exhausted before your day even starts.</p>
        <p>It means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Waking up early</strong> to shovel before work, or shovelling in the dark after</li>
            <li><strong>Sore backs and pulled muscles</strong> from lifting heavy, wet snow</li>
            <li><strong>Slippery steps</strong> that put your family, delivery drivers, and mail carriers at risk</li>
            <li><strong>City bylaws</strong> that don't care if you're sick, travelling, or just exhausted</li>
            <li><strong>The constant mental load</strong> of watching forecasts and wondering, "When do I have to do this again?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You're a busy homeowner. You have a job, kids, or health concerns. Or you're a senior who shouldn't be shovelling at all. Or you're a landlord who doesn't live on-site but needs to stay compliant.</p>
        <p><strong>You don't need another chore. You need it handled.</strong></p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Snow Removal That Works Like a Utility</h2>
        <p>You don't think about your internet bill. You don't think about your electricity. You shouldn't have to think about snow removal, either.</p>
        <p><strong>Red Deer Snow Route</strong> is a simple subscription service. One flat monthly fee. Unlimited clears every time it snows 2 cm or more. We show up automatically, clear your driveway and walkways, and text you a photo when we're done.</p>
        <p>You pay the same amount every month, whether it snows once or ten times. No surprises. No contracts. Cancel any time before the next month.</p>
        <p><strong>Your driveway and sidewalk are cleared within 12–24 hours after the snow stops, or your month is free.</strong></p>

        <hr>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Enter Your Address and Choose a Plan</h3>
        <p>Tell us where you live and select the plan that fits your property. Most homes in Red Deer fit our Standard Plan.</p>
        <h3>Step 2: We Confirm Your Spot</h3>
        <p>We'll confirm you're on our route and send you your start date. Your subscription begins when the first significant snowfall hits.</p>
        <h3>Step 3: We Clear Automatically</h3>
        <p>Every time it snows 2 cm or more, we automatically show up, clear your driveway, front walkway, front steps, and sidewalk, then text you a photo. You don't need to call, schedule, or think about it.</p>
        <h3>Step 4: One Flat Monthly Fee</h3>
        <p>You pay the same amount every month, regardless of how many times we visit. Cancel any time before the next month with no penalties.</p>

        <h2>Why This Beats Doing It Yourself (Or Hiring Random Kids)</h2>
        <h3>Compared to DIY:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time:</strong> Save 30–60 minutes per snowfall. That's 10–20 hours per winter you get back.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety:</strong> No risk of back injury, heart strain, or falls on ice.</li>
            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> No buying, storing, or maintaining shovels, snow blowers, or ice melt.</li>
            <li><strong>Early mornings:</strong> Sleep in. We handle it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Compared to One-Off Cash Deals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> They might not show up. We're scheduled and guaranteed.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Random kids aren't insured. We are.</li>
            <li><strong>Proof:</strong> You get a text and photo every time. No guessing if it was done.</li>
            <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> You have someone to call. We're a real local business, not a faceless app.</li>
            <li><strong>Route-limited:</strong> We cap our route at 40 homes to ensure we can always deliver on our promise.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>We're not a gig app. We're a local Red Deer team with real people who show up, every time.</strong></p>

        <h2>What Red Deer Homeowners Are Saying</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "I haven't touched a shovel in two winters. They text me a photo every time they clear, and I can relax knowing my sidewalk is always bylaw-compliant. Worth every penny."<br>
            – <em>Sarah M., Red Deer</em>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "As a senior, shovelling was getting dangerous. Now I just check my phone in the morning and see the photo that it's done. It's like having a reliable neighbour who never forgets."<br>
            – <em>Robert K., Sylvan Lake</em>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "I'm a landlord with three properties. This service keeps me compliant without having to drive across town every time it snows. The flat monthly fee makes budgeting easy."<br>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>How often do you come?</h3>
        <p>We come automatically every time it snows 2 cm or more. There's no limit to how many times we visit in a month. You pay the same flat fee whether it snows once or ten times.</p>
        <h3>What counts as "enough snow" for a visit?</h3>
        <p>2 centimetres or more of snowfall triggers a visit. We monitor the weather and come out after the snow stops falling.</p>
        <h3>What if it keeps snowing all day?</h3>
        <p>If it snows continuously, we'll clear once the snow stops. If it snows again the next day, we'll clear again. That's what "unlimited visits" means.</p>
        <h3>What if I'm away or at work when you come?</h3>
        <p>You don't need to be home. We'll clear your property and text you a photo when we're done. You'll know it's handled even if you're travelling or at the office.</p>
        <h3>Do you use salt / ice melt?</h3>
        <p>We use ice melt when needed to prevent ice buildup. If you want premium ice-melt treatment, you can add that as an upgrade.</p>
        <h3>Can I cancel any time?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Cancel before the next month's billing cycle with no penalties or fees. No long-term contracts.</p>
        <h3>Do you clear the city sidewalk in front of my home?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We clear the sidewalk along the front of your property, which is typically your responsibility under Red Deer bylaws.</p>
        <h3>What areas of Red Deer do you cover?</h3>
        <p>We cover Red Deer and nearby bedroom communities including Sylvan Lake, Blackfalds, Penhold, Springbrook, and Lacombe. Enter your address during signup to confirm coverage.</p>
        <h3>Do you do roofs, decks, or back alleys?</h3>
        <p>No. We focus on driveways, front walkways, front steps, and front sidewalks. We're residential-only and don't do commercial parking lots, roofs, or back alleys. If you need additional paths cleared, check our add-on options.</p>

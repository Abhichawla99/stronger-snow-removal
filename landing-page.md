## Winter in Red Deer Doesn't Have to Be a Battle

It's 6:15 AM on a Tuesday. You look out the window and see 20 centimetres of fresh snow covering your driveway. Your sidewalk is buried. The city requires it cleared within 24 hours, or you face a fine.

You have two choices: shovel now and risk being late for work, or shovel later and risk your back giving out. Again.

This isn't a one-time problem. In Red Deer, winter means repeated snowfalls. It means -20°C mornings where your breath freezes and your hands go numb. It means wet, heavy snow that strains your heart and leaves you exhausted before your day even starts.

It means:
- **Waking up early** to shovel before work, or shovelling in the dark after
- **Sore backs and pulled muscles** from lifting heavy, wet snow
- **Slippery steps** that put your family, delivery drivers, and mail carriers at risk
- **City bylaws** that don't care if you're sick, travelling, or just exhausted
- **The constant mental load** of watching forecasts and wondering, "When do I have to do this again?"

You're a busy homeowner. You have a job, kids, or health concerns. Or you're a senior who shouldn't be shovelling at all. Or you're a landlord who doesn't live on-site but needs to stay compliant.

You don't need another chore. You need it handled.

## Snow Removal That Works Like a Utility

You don't think about your internet bill. You don't think about your electricity. You shouldn't have to think about snow removal, either.

**Red Deer Snow Route** is a simple subscription service. One flat monthly fee. Unlimited clears every time it snows 2 cm or more. We show up automatically, clear your driveway and walkways, and text you a photo when we're done.

You pay the same amount every month, whether it snows once or ten times. No surprises. No contracts. Cancel any time before the next month.

**Your driveway and sidewalk are cleared within 12–24 hours after the snow stops, or your month is free.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often do you come?
We come automatically every time it snows 2 cm or more. There's no limit to how many times we visit in a month. You pay the same flat fee whether it snows once or ten times.

### What counts as "enough snow" for a visit?
2 centimetres or more of snowfall triggers a visit. We monitor the weather and come out after the snow stops falling.

### What if it keeps snowing all day?
If it snows continuously, we'll clear once the snow stops. If it snows again the next day, we'll clear again. That's what "unlimited visits" means.

### What if I'm away or at work when you come?
You don't need to be home. We'll clear your property and text you a photo when we're done. You'll know it's handled even if you're travelling or at the office.

### Do you use salt / ice melt?
We use ice melt when needed to prevent ice buildup. If you want premium ice-melt treatment, you can add that as an upgrade.

### Can I cancel any time?
Yes. Cancel before the next month's billing cycle with no penalties or fees. No long-term contracts.

### Do you clear the city sidewalk in front of my home?
Yes. We clear the sidewalk along the front of your property, which is typically your responsibility under Red Deer bylaws.

### What areas of Red Deer do you cover?
We cover Red Deer and nearby bedroom communities including Sylvan Lake, Blackfalds, Penhold, Springbrook, and Lacombe. Enter your address during signup to confirm coverage.

### Do you do roofs, decks, or back alleys?
No. We focus on driveways, front walkways, front steps, and front sidewalks. We're residential-only and don't do commercial parking lots, roofs, or back alleys. If you need additional paths cleared, check our add-on options.
